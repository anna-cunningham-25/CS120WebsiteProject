# CS120WebsiteProject
Website task

Your task is to work together as a team to create the design of a small basic website with at least 6 pages. This should be built in at least two stages such that you have an initial project which is forked to produce a development branch (for the second stage of development where you might add new functionality to your web pages) and then subsequently merged back into the original branch.

The subject and content of the website are left to your discretion. You should create a public Github respository for this project and work collaboratively on the project.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WRITE ANY CODE, THE FILES THAT YOU COLLABORATE ON ONLY NEED TO BE TEXT FILES GIVING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED WEBSITE.

You should connect to the Git Hub repository using either IntelliJ (ITSD & DTSP students) or PyCharm (ITMB students). You may be asked by your tutor to show that you have done this during the week 4 mandatory day.

You should organise your project in order that you can demonstrate that everyone has contributed code (for at least one initial and one updated page) to the project.

You must fully document the development of the project with a particular emphasis on how you collaborated using Github.
